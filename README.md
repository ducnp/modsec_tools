## What
After installing mod_security2, the amount of data generated in the logfiles made figuring out what was going on hard, so these scripts aim to provide some simple information with which to make decisions about rulesets to use.

## Input Files
If input files have been gzipped they will be opened and read by the scipt, so the files to analyse can be specified as /var/log/apache2/modsec_audit.log* and all files present will be analysed.

## Filtering
There are many ways that the audit files may need to be filtered, and the analyse_audit script tries to provide a few of the more useful ones. 

- --filter TXT requires that TXT is present for one of the rules that matched a request
- --filter-id NNNNNN requires that one of the rules that matched a request had the ID provided.
- --filter-host HOST requires the hostname the request was made to contains HOST (from the Host header)
- --filter-response NNN requires the request provoked the response given
- --filter-uid UUUU requires the request unique id contain the supplied characters
- --filter-rules When specified only requests that triggered mod_security2 rules will be included
- --filter-no-rule When specified only requests that did not trigger a mod_security2 rule will be included.

The last 2 filters are included for when the SecAuditEngine has a setting that includes relevant entries. This will normally capture a lot of requests that are triggered for reasons other than mod_security2 rules (simple 404's for instance). Sometimes it's useful to review these or to exclude these, hence these 2 filters. They cannot be used together!

## Output
There are various summaries that are available, but the requests can be output in more verbose for additional study. All summaries and output is applied after any filtering.

- --rule-summary Will display a summary of the rules that have matched requests
- --client-summary Displays a list of the number of times a remote IP address was used (long list)
- --file-summary Lists the files and line numbers that rules used are found in

To view additional details of requests made,

- --show-requests Will show a summary of each log entry
- --show-full Will show the full log entry

## Examples

The rule summary gives a good indication of which rules are working and proving effective.
